#### Description: 
Wishlistly is a web app created with React for the frontend and
pytohn flask for the backend.
It is a wishlist app catered for elderly people, meaning it is simple,
easy to use and with elements that are easy to read and grasp.
In the app there are tons of functionality such as server side authentication,
that stores a cookie in the browser and an sqlite database that handles user
information such as name, email and hashed password. It also stores the wishes and 
the users friends. frontend makes requests to the backend server and gets or posts the 
information needed to make the actions possible, such as adding a friend, displaying all friends,
creating new wishes, deleteing wishes, removing friends, changeing profile picture or passwords.
I also added a search feature that lets you search through all users in the the database and add them
to your friends array that stores the user_ids of the people you add.
If a user is not logged in, they see a landing page explaining what the app is, with buttons
for signup or login. Throughout the app i have tried to use the best practices to make the best app possible.

Have a look around the app. Im proud to finally be able to show it off!
